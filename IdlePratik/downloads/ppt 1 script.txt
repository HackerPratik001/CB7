introduction:-

On 28th July, a meeting of the Maharashtra Ekiaran Parishad was held in Mumbai. 
The president of the parishad was Shankarrao Dev. During the meeting, a resolution was 
passed that all Marathi-speaking regions should be included in one state. This includes 
areas like Mumbai, Central provisions, Marathawada, and Gomantak. The resolution was aimed 
at consolidating all Marathi-speaking regions and bringing them together under one state. 
This move was seen as a step towardspromoting the cultural and linguistic 
unity of the Marathi-speaking population.

Background :- 


At the start of the 20th century, many scholars expressed the idea of unifying 
Marathi-speaking people. In 1911, when the British government suspended the partition of 
Bengal, N.C. Kelkar wrote that all Marathi-speaking people should be together in one dominion. 
In 1915, Lokmanya Tilak also demanded the formation of a state based on language. 
However, at that time, the issue of Indian independence was more important, so this 
idea was not given much importance. On 12 May 1946, an important resolution was passed 
at the Sahitya Sammelan in Belgaum regarding the formation of Samyukta Maharashtra, which 
means the unification of all Marathi-speaking regions.
