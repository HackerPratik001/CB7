After India became independent, people demanded that states be reorganized based on language. In Maharashtra, people wanted a state for Marathi-speaking people. So, from 1946 onwards, a movement called the "Samyukta Maharashtra Movement" started. The movement progressed through different situations and finally, on 1 May 1960, the state of Maharashtra was formed.

From the beginning of
20th century, many scholars had begun
to express the thoughts on unification of
Marathi speaking people. In 1911, the
British Government had to suspend the
partition of Bengal. On this background,
N.C.Kelkar wrote that ‘the entire Marathi
speaking population should be under one
dominion’. In 1915, Lokmanya Tilak had
demanded the reconstruction of a state
based on language. But during that period
the issue of independence of India was
more important, hence this issue remained
aside.
On 12 May 1946, in the Sahitya
Sammelan at Belgaon, an important
resolution regarding Samyukta
Maharashtra was passed.

At the start of the 20th century, many scholars expressed the idea of unifying Marathi-speaking people. In 1911, when the British government suspended the partition of Bengal, N.C. Kelkar wrote that all Marathi-speaking people should be together in one dominion. In 1915, Lokmanya Tilak also demanded the formation of a state based on language. However, at that time, the issue of Indian independence was more important, so this idea was not given much importance. On 12 May 1946, an important resolution was passed at the Sahitya Sammelan in Belgaum regarding the formation of Samyukta Maharashtra, which means the unification of all Marathi-speaking regions.
